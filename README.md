### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rasmus Gerdin, I'm from Stockholm, Sweden, and I'm a node.js & web developer, photographer, IT professional, and all-around tech enthusiast.

You may know me from the [RTByte] project (a bot for [Discord]), that I've been working on since December of 2016. 

I'm very active on [Discord] (rasmus#0001), and I [tweet] every now and then. Please take the time to check out my [website] if you'd like to learn more about me!
